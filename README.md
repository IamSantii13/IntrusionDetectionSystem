# Intrusion Detection System (IDS)
 Developed a machine learning-based Intrusion detection system(IDS) using Python in Jupyter Notebook to analyze network traffic and detect malicious activity.

This project explores the use of AI to classify network traffic patterns as either malicious (attack traffic) or benign (normal traffic).

Key Tasks:
- Data collection and Network traffic analysis on a Azure Vitual Machine
- Simulating and injecting attack traffic
- AI Model Development for intrusion detection
- Performance Evaluation and Optimization
